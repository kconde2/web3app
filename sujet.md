## Skil Test: Full Stack Web3 developer

**Objective**: evaluate your skills in using a web3 library to fetch the balance on a EVM chain.

**Taks:**

1. Set up a new Next.js project using the app router
2. Build a simple form that include fields to input an Ethereum address and select a chain (either Mode Mainnet or Ethereum Mainnet).
3. Implement form submission: on submission, call a Next.js API endpoint to return the balance of the given address on the selected chain.
 1. Use the `viem` npm package for fetching the balance
 2. display the result in a readeable format
4. example addresses:
 1. on ethereum mainnet: https://etherscan.io/address/0x4838b106fce9647bdf1e7877bf73ce8b0bad5f97
 2. on mode mainnet: https://explorer.mode.network/address/0x58c0179d43d2Ccb0459eb151F35CeB7eEdbB7FA4
5. do not implement any wallet connection

**Time Frame:**

- Development: Approximately 3 hours
- Submission: Within 1 week

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, code self-explanatory which does not require comments
- **Error Handling**: Proper handling of API errors, invalid inputs, and edge cases.
- **Documentation**: Provide a brief README explaining how to run the project, technical choices, and any difficulties encountered
